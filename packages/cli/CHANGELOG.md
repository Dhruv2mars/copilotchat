# @dhruv2mars/copilotchat

## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- Fix installer package-version lookup so first-run native binary download uses the real published version instead of falling back to `v0.0.0`.
- Restore Bun global install download flow end to end.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- Fix Bun global install path resolution so the launcher follows the real package path instead of the symlink shim path.
- Restore first-run native binary download for Bun-installed `copilotchat`.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- Remove all Keychain and system secret-store usage from auth storage paths.
- Save local auth only in `~/.copilotchat/session.json` with locked file permissions.
- Remove the old bridge Keychain path too, so no shipped app path depends on system secret-store prompts.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- Publish the first working Rust CLI release with GitHub Copilot auth, model listing, terminal chat, and npm/GitHub Release distribution.
